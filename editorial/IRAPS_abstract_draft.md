**Thesis:** Vertebral subluxation, as traditionally understood, represents a compensatory adaptation rather than a primary event. The foundational interference occurs upstream within the NeuroSpinal System — specifically through sustained aberrant tension in the Cranio-Spinal Meningeal Functional Unit (C-SMFU) — which precedes and drives structural changes observed at the vertebral level.

**Premises:** (1) The meningeal system possesses intrinsic contractile motility mediated by myofibroblasts within the dura, pia, and arachnoid layers. (2) Under perceived threat — physical, chemical, or emotional — this system contracts defensively as an intelligent protective response. (3) This contractile state persists long after the original stressor resolves, maintained as stored adaptive tension awaiting specific informational input for release. (4) Vertebral positioning changes, muscular bracing, and segmental fixation arise as secondary compensatory adaptations to this primary meningeal tension. (5) Modern research demonstrates that neural interference stems predominantly from tension and altered afferent signaling rather than mechanical compression.

**Support:** This model explains clinical phenomena that traditional compression-based models cannot: why subluxations recur so readily, why some patients respond immediately while others require sustained care, and why segmental correction without addressing foundational tone yields temporary results. The persistence of meningeal bracing after stress resolution accounts for the sustained nature of subluxation and explains why the body cannot self-correct without specific directional input parallel to the vector of unwinding.

**Synthesis:** Talsky Tonal Chiropractic integrates these insights into a clinical paradigm that honors chiropractic's foundational principle — reduction of interference to nervous system expression — while providing mechanistic clarity grounded in contemporary neuroscience. By engaging the NeuroSpinal System through precise, non-articular contact delivered in the direction of ease, TTC facilitates the body's reinitiation of its own self-correcting process, addressing the primary tone-setting mechanism rather than its structural compensations.
