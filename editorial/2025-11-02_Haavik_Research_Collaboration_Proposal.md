# Research Collaboration Proposal: TTC and Haavik Lab

## Purpose
This document outlines a potential research collaboration between Talsky Tonal Chiropractic (TTC) and Dr. Heidi Haavik's research team to investigate neurophysiological effects of non-articular tonal adjustments.

---

## Background: Why This Collaboration Makes Sense

### Haavik's Established Research Foundation
Dr. Heidi Haavik's groundbreaking research has demonstrated that chiropractic adjustments produce measurable changes in brain function:
- Nearly **20% change in prefrontal cortex activity** after adjusting dysfunctional spinal segments
- Improvements in **sensorimotor integration** and **neuroplasticity**
- Paradigm shift from "bone-on-nerve compression" to **"tension, distortion, and altered afferent input"**

Her key measurement tools:
- **Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs)** - sensory signal transmission
- **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)** - motor cortex excitability
- **fMRI** - brain activity visualization
- **EEG** - brainwave patterns and coherence

### TTC's Unique Research Potential

**TTC offers several advantages over osseous techniques for neurophysiological research:**

1. **More direct NeuroSpinal engagement**
   - Osseous techniques engage the nervous system indirectly through joint mechanoreceptors
   - TTC engages directly through meningeal-dural contacts
   - Hypothesis: Should produce clearer/stronger neurological signals

2. **Cleaner variable isolation**
   - Osseous adjustments create joint cavitation, muscle stretch, multiple mechanoreceptor inputs
   - TTC's non-articular approach isolates the **meningeal-dural-CNS pathway**
   - Easier to attribute measured changes to specific mechanisms

3. **Built-in verification method**
   - Leg balancing reflex = real-time neurological confirmation
   - Could itself be measured (reflex latency, duration, completeness)
   - Provides objective confirmation of neurological engagement

4. **Precision and reproducibility**
   - Tonal pressure testing + leg check verification = standardized protocol
   - "Best window in" methodology = objective criteria
   - Potentially more reproducible than osseous technique variables

## Proposed Research Studies

### Study 1: Direct Comparison of Tonal vs. Osseous Adjustments

**Research Question:** Does non-articular tonal adjustment produce different or stronger brain activity changes compared to articular adjustment?

**Design:**
- Randomized controlled trial
- Two groups: TTC vs. Diversified/Gonstead
- Use Haavik's established SEP and fMRI protocols
- Measure prefrontal cortex activity, sensorimotor integration changes

**Hypothesis:** TTC shows equal or greater changes in cortical processing and sensorimotor integration

**Significance:** First direct comparison of tonal vs. osseous techniques using neuroimaging

---

### Study 2: Isolation of the Meningeal-Dural Pathway

**Research Question:** Can we isolate the meningeal-dural pathway's contribution to brain function changes?

**Design:**
- TTC contacts (meningeal/dural engagement) vs. sham contact (same location, no therapeutic intent/vector)
- Measure SEPs, fMRI, cortical processing
- Control for tactile stimulation alone

**Hypothesis:** Therapeutic TTC contacts produce measurable brain changes beyond tactile stimulation alone

**Significance:** **Groundbreaking** - First study to isolate this specific neurological pathway's effects on brain function

---

### Study 3: Leg Check Reflex as Neurological Marker

**Research Question:** Is the leg balancing reflex correlated with measurable brain changes?

**Design:**
- Simultaneous measurement of SEPs/fMRI and leg length changes during tonal pressure testing
- Correlate timing and magnitude of leg balancing with cortical activity changes
- Assess whether degree of balancing predicts magnitude of brain response

**Hypothesis:** Temporary leg balancing reflex correlates with magnitude of cortical processing changes

**Significance:** Could validate leg checks as objective neurological indicators, not just clinical assessment tools

---

### Study 4: Dose-Response Relationship

**Research Question:** What is the minimum effective input for neurological change?

**Design:**
- Vary TTC contact parameters (pressure, duration, vector precision)
- Measure brain response to different "doses"
- TTC's "least amount of most effective" principle = testable hypothesis

**Hypothesis:** Minimal, precisely vectored inputs produce neurological changes; effectiveness plateaus beyond optimal threshold

**Significance:** Could optimize clinical protocols and validate TTC's minimal-input philosophy

---

### Study 5: Intent as Measurable Variable (Exploratory)

**Research Question:** Does practitioner intent measurably influence neurological outcomes?

**Design:**
- Practitioners deliver TTC contacts under two conditions:
  - Focused congruent intent (normal clinical state)
  - Distracted/neutral state (performing mental arithmetic during contact)
- Measure brain activity changes in both conditions
- Double-blind where possible (patient unaware of practitioner's state)

**Hypothesis:** Focused congruent intent amplifies neurological changes

**Significance:** Tests B.J. Palmer's "something extra" - controversial but potentially paradigm-shifting

**Note:** This would be exploratory and likely requires Studies 1-3 to be completed first

## Initial Outreach Email Draft

**Subject:** Research Collaboration Proposal - Neurophysiological Effects of Tonal Chiropractic

Dear Dr. Haavik,

I am writing to propose a research collaboration that builds on your groundbreaking work demonstrating the neurophysiological effects of chiropractic adjustments.

Your research has fundamentally shifted the paradigm from compression-based to tension-based models of subluxation, showing that neural interference stems from altered afferent input rather than direct nerve compression. This aligns perfectly with Talsky Tonal Chiropractic (TTC), a non-articular approach that engages the NeuroSpinal System directly through meningeal-dural contacts rather than through joint mechanoreceptors.

**I believe TTC offers a unique opportunity to:**
1. Isolate the meningeal-dural pathway's contribution to the brain changes you've documented
2. Compare neurophysiological effects of articular vs. non-articular approaches
3. Investigate whether leg check reflexes correlate with measurable cortical changes

TTC's non-articular methodology may produce clearer neurological signals in SEP/fMRI studies by eliminating variables associated with joint cavitation and articular mechanoreceptor stimulation.

I have prepared a detailed research proposal outlining potential studies that would replicate your established protocols using TTC technique. Would you be open to a brief video call to discuss the feasibility of this collaboration?

I have attached:
1. Research collaboration proposal (detailed study designs)
2. TTC white paper (theoretical foundation and clinical methodology)

Thank you for considering this opportunity. Your work has been foundational to advancing the scientific understanding of chiropractic, and I believe this collaboration could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying tonal approaches.

Best regards,

[Your name and credentials]

- Provide objective measures for "best window in" methodology
- Potentially validate leg checks as neurological indicators
- Create a model for tonal technique research
- Open doors for further studies on intent, minimal effective dose, and long-term neuroplasticity changes

**The ultimate goal:** Advance tonal chiropractic from philosophical/clinical tradition to scientifically validated methodology with measurable neurophysiological effects.

## Questions to Prepare For

**Haavik's team will likely ask:**

1. **How standardized is TTC?**
   - Can different practitioners deliver identical contacts?
   - What is inter-practitioner reliability?

2. **What is the control condition?**
   - How do we differentiate therapeutic contact from placebo touch?
   - What is the sham protocol?

3. **Sample size requirements?**
   - Based on her previous studies, likely need 40-60 subjects per group
   - Are there enough TTC practitioners to recruit subjects?

4. **Funding commitment?**
   - Who pays for what?
   - Timeline for securing funding?

5. **Publication expectations?**
   - Authorship order
   - Which journals to target
   - Data sharing agreements

**Be prepared to answer these with specifics.**

  - Post-concussive syndrome
  - Neurodivergent populations (autism, ADHD)
  - Chronic stress/anxiety
  - Athletic performance

### Comparative Effectiveness Research
