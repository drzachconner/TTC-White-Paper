## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- White paper format (not journal) — no word count limits, philosophical voice preserved
- Epstein/Senzon/Talsky refs kept — authoritative for chiropractic audience
- Gemini audit folded into Phase 2 — Claude does cross-rendition comparison directly from repo
- Intent section (PEAR/RNG) treatment deferred to Phase 3 (Credibility)
- Cascade sequence: Option B — add definitional paragraph in Part VI mapping all 5 terms with callbacks
- First Principles: Restore standalone section from renditions 03-05 with tension-resolving paragraph
- Part X trimming: Shorten opening to callback, preserve unique trajectory/practitioner content
- Content recovery: All 13 items approved (9 AUTHOR DECIDE + 4 pre-approved RECOVER)
- Editorial feedback TODOs: All 3 outstanding items approved for Plan 02-02

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
