<objective>
Execute all author-approved structural edits on the master paper in a single coherent pass: restructure the Executive Summary, consolidate redundancies, recover lost content, incorporate editorial feedback, and verify nothing was lost.

Purpose: This is the editing pass that transforms the audit findings into actual changes. All decisions have been approved by the author in Plan 01. This plan executes them and verifies integrity.

Output: A structurally sound master paper where each concept has one definitive home, lost content is recovered, and editorial feedback is incorporated — verified against the vital aspects checklist and citation index.

  <name>Task 1: Execute structural edits — Executive Summary, redundancy consolidation, content recovery, and editorial feedback</name>
  <files>renditions/01_2026-02-03_MASTER_PAPER_COMPLETE.md</files>
  <action>
Read the author-approved decisions from `02-01-AUDIT.md` (and the 02-01-SUMMARY.md for any additional context). Then read the full master paper. Execute ALL approved changes in a single editing pass, working section by section from top to bottom:

**A. Executive Summary (STRC-01)**

Restructure the Executive Summary to follow this flow per RESEARCH.md findings:
1. Central Question (keep current opening — "If subluxation is fundamentally about altered nervous system tone...")
2. Thesis (the clinical mechanism)
3. Core Insight (meningeal system as the primary tone-setting architecture)
4. Clinical Consequence (how TTC engages this system)
5. Paradigm (philosophical/ontological context — positioned LAST as optional deepening, not prerequisite)

The goal is that the philosophical content (Universal Intelligence, Innate Intelligence, ontological framing) comes after the clinical substance. A reader should be able to stop after "Clinical Consequence" and understand TTC's core argument. The Paradigm section deepens for those who want the philosophical context.

**B. Redundancy Consolidation (STRC-02, STRC-03, STRC-04)**

For each redundancy instance approved for action in 02-01-AUDIT.md:

- **CUT items**: Remove the passage entirely. Ensure the surrounding text still flows.
- **CALLBACK items**: Replace the passage with a brief cross-reference, e.g., "As described in Part II, the TTC clinician does not seek to apply force to what is stuck but rather..." (1-2 sentences max, enough to maintain local context without duplicating the full treatment).
- **KEEP items**: Leave as-is.

Specific guidance per concept (modify based on author's approved decisions):
- "Misinformation/missing information": Part VI owns full mechanistic treatment. Part II keeps shortened intro. Part IV section 4.3 gets callback or cut.
- "We do not seek to apply force": Part II (Clinical Art) is definitive home. Part I section 1.2 keeps brief preview.
- Cascade sequence: Execute per author's choice (Option A or B from audit).
- "Body is intelligent system": Per-instance assessment. Focus cuts on Part X which substantially restates Part II.
- "Least amount of most effective input": Part II (operational), Part VI (mechanistic), Part VII (protocol) are the three legitimate treatments. Cut/callback in Parts VIII, X, XII.
- Part II vs Part VI overlap: Shorten Part II "Clinical Problem" to ~50% with forward reference to Part VI, per approved recommendation.

**C. Content Recovery (STRC-05)**

For each content item approved for recovery in 02-01-AUDIT.md:
- Read the source rendition passage
- Integrate into the master paper at the recommended location
- When recovered content conflicts with existing master text, use whichever version is better-written (per user decision in CONTEXT.md)
- Ensure recovered content matches the surrounding voice and formatting

**D. Editorial Feedback Incorporation (STRC-06)**

For each approved TODO item from the editorial feedback gap analysis:
- Implement the change as specified
- If the "it's/its" possessive error exists, fix it
- If the First Principles tension resolution was approved, implement the chosen option (A or B)
- Do NOT implement items classified as PHASE 4 or SKIP

**E. Cross-reference Check After All Edits**

After all edits are complete, do a quick scan:
- Ensure all "As described in Part X..." references point to real sections
- Ensure no dangling forward references ("as we will see in Part Y") point to removed content
- Fix any paragraph transitions that became awkward due to cuts

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (from CLAUDE.md and CONTEXT.md):
- Voice preservation: The philosophical-clinical blend IS the paper's identity. Refine, don't flatten.
- Length is NOT a goal to reduce — only cut when genuinely redundant
- Haavik Research Collaboration Proposal must NOT influence this paper
- When in doubt between cutting and keeping, KEEP
  </action>
  <verify>
- Master paper file has been modified (git diff shows changes)
- Executive Summary now ends with philosophical/ontological content (Paradigm section last)
- Searching for "misinformation" or "missing information" returns the full treatment in one primary location
- Searching for "we do not seek to apply force" returns the definitive treatment in Part II
- Any content recovery additions are present at their designated locations
  </verify>
  <done>
The master paper has been structurally edited per all author-approved decisions: Executive Summary restructured with mechanism-first flow, redundancies consolidated with definitive homes established, lost content recovered, and editorial feedback incorporated.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Post-edit verification — vital aspects checklist, citation integrity, and argumentative flow</name>
  <files>renditions/01_2026-02-03_MASTER_PAPER_COMPLETE.md</files>
  <action>
Three verification passes on the edited master paper:

**1. Vital Aspects Verification (CRITICAL — from CLAUDE.md: "Never delete content without checking")**

Read `renditions/08_2025-11-02_vital_aspects.md` in its entirety. For every principle/concept listed in the vital aspects document:
- Search the master paper for the concept
- Confirm it is present and substantively intact (not just mentioned in passing)
- If any vital aspect is missing or diluted, immediately restore it — either by reverting the cut or by adding the concept back in its most appropriate location

Document the verification results in the SUMMARY for this plan.

**2. Citation Integrity Check**

Scan the master paper for all in-text citations (pattern: parenthetical author-year references like "(Holder, 2009)" or "Epstein (1986)").
- For each in-text citation, verify it has a matching entry in the References section
- For each References entry, verify it is cited at least once in the body text
- If any citations were orphaned by structural changes (passage containing the citation was moved or cut), either:
  - Move the citation to the location where the concept now lives, OR
  - Remove the orphaned Reference entry if the concept is no longer discussed

Cross-reference against `editorial/2026-02-26_perplexity_citation_audit.md` to ensure Phase 1 fixes are preserved.

**3. Sequential Flow Check**

Read the paper from start to finish (Executive Summary through Epilogue) and verify:
- No logical gaps where a removed passage breaks the argumentative chain
- All "as described above/below" and "as we will see" references point to real content
- Cross-references ("As described in Part X...") use correct Part numbers
- Transitions between sections still flow naturally
- No abrupt topic changes where a removed passage was bridging two ideas

If any issues are found in any verification pass, fix them directly in the master paper.
  </action>
  <verify>
- Every item in vital aspects checklist (renditions/08) can be found in the master paper via text search
- In-text citation count matches or is close to References entry count (no large discrepancies)
- No "as described in Part X" references point to nonexistent content
- Paper reads coherently from Executive Summary through Epilogue without logical jumps
  </verify>
  <done>
All three verification passes complete: vital aspects confirmed present, citation chain intact with no orphans, and sequential read confirms the argument flows without gaps. Any issues found during verification have been fixed in the master paper.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. The master paper is structurally different from its pre-Phase-2 state (git diff confirms changes)
2. Executive Summary positions clinical mechanism before philosophical framing
3. No concept appears in full treatment in more than one location (spot-check 3 concepts from the redundancy map)
4. Vital aspects checklist: 100% of items verified present
5. Citation integrity: Every in-text citation has a References match and vice versa
6. Sequential read: The argument flows from Executive Summary through Epilogue without logical gaps
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- STRC-01: Executive Summary leads with clinical mechanism, philosophical framing positioned last
- STRC-02: "Misinformation/missing information" has one primary location with callbacks only
- STRC-03: "We do not seek to apply force" has one definitive placement in Part II
- STRC-04: Cascade sequence consolidated per author's chosen option
- STRC-05: All author-approved content recovery items integrated
- STRC-06: All author-approved editorial feedback items incorporated
- Vital aspects: 100% verified present
- Citation integrity: No orphaned citations in either direction
- Voice: Paper still reads as clinical-philosophical, not flattened
