## Redundancy Findings

### Concept 1: "Misinformation / Missing Information" Framework

| # | Location | First ~20 Words | Words | Purpose | Recommendation |
|---|----------|-----------------|-------|---------|----------------|
| 1a | Part I, "The Clinical Problem" (lines 42-51) | "When incoming stress exceeds the body's adaptive capacity, the NeuroSpinal System tightens as an allostatic response..." | ~200 | Introduces the concept as the clinical problem TTC addresses; establishes the two distortions (misinformation + missing information) with bullet points | **KEEP** -- First encounter; frames the clinical problem before method |
| 1b | Part IV, section 4.1 (line 190) | "...the neurological interference in communication between brain and body that occurs first and foremost in the aberrant tension within the C-SMFU..." | ~40 | Embedded in historical contrast -- mentions interference but does not repeat the bullet-point framework | **KEEP** -- Different angle (historical critique of osseous models) |
| 1c | Part III, "The NeuroSpinal System as the Fountainhead of Tone" (line 175) | "...creating postural shifts, gait disturbances, and joint fixations -- initiating the cascade of dyskinesia..." | ~30 | Mentions the cascade consequence (which includes informational interference) | **KEEP** -- This is about the cascade, not the misinformation framework per se |
| 1d | Part VI, "Pathophysiology" section "The Sequence: From Threat to Release" step 4 (line 381) | "Informational Interference: Reduced variability and fidelity of afferent/efferent signals (misinformation + missing information)" | ~15 | One-line reference within the 8-step sequence | **KEEP** -- Contextually appropriate within the sequence |
| 1e | Part VI, "Why Precision Matters" section (lines 358-374) | "...creates a maze of tension that gross movement cannot penetrate..." with references to compensatory layers obscuring informational flow | ~200 | Full mechanistic treatment of why precise input is needed -- discusses compensatory layers, information quality, and why gross force fails | **KEEP** -- This is the mechanistic explanation, distinct from Part I's clinical framing |

**Definitive home:** Part I (The Clinical Problem) for the introductory clinical framing; Part VI (Pathophysiology) for the mechanistic explanation.

**Assessment:** The RESEARCH.md analysis identified potential verbatim duplication between Part I ("The Clinical Problem") and a Part IV section 4.3 (Allostatic Load). However, in the current master paper (01), Part IV has been restructured as "From Bone-on-Nerve to Tone-First: Historical Evolution" and no longer contains a verbatim Allostatic Load subsection. The near-identical duplication identified in RESEARCH.md appears to have been partially resolved during the Feb 2026 rewrite. The remaining mentions serve distinct purposes. **No cuts needed here.**

### Concept 2: "We do not seek to apply force to what is stuck" / Three Contrasts

| # | Location | First ~20 Words | Words | Purpose | Recommendation |
|---|----------|-----------------|-------|---------|----------------|
| 2a | Part I, "The Clinical Method" (lines 60-66) | "This is not osseous, not articular. Talsky Tonal Chiropractic treats that proposition as literal..." | ~100 | Full treatment as part of the clinical method description; includes "not osseous, not articular" and the non-articular paradigm shift | **KEEP** -- Definitive home within the method |
| 2b | Part I, "The Paradigm Shift" (lines 81-82) | "This is a move from segmental correction to system reorganization, from mechanical adjustment to informational precision..." | ~80 | Restates the contrast in summary form at end of Part I | **KEEP** -- Natural conclusion to the method section |
| 2c | Part VIII, "What TTC Is and Is Not" (lines 517-525) | "Not about using enough force to move a bone, about delivering the least amount..." | ~150 | The "Not / About" comparative list that includes the force/receptivity contrast | **KEEP** -- Serves comparative positioning purpose (different audience need) |
| 2d | Part X, "Clinical Expectations" (line 577) | "TTC is not about moving bones. It is about delivering the least amount of the most effective information..." | ~80 | Restates for the clinical expectations context | **CALLBACK** -- This substantially repeats Part I and Part VIII without adding new content from a clinical expectations perspective |

**Note:** The three-line contrast from the vital aspects checklist ("We do not seek to apply force to what is stuck / We are not looking for what's fixated / We are not looking for the most resistance") appears directly in the Executive Thesis (line 31 of master) but NOT in the body of the paper. The vital aspects document is a standalone reference, not part of the paper.

**Definitive home:** Part I (The Clinical Method) for full treatment; Part VIII for comparative positioning.

**Recommendation:** Consider shortening Part X's opening to reference Part I rather than restating. The "not about moving bones" refrain appears 3 times in the paper (Part I, Part VIII, Part X).

---

### Concept 3: Cascade Sequence (dyskinesia, dysafferentation, dysponesis, dysautonomia, degeneration)

| # | Location | First ~20 Words | Words | Purpose | Recommendation |
|---|----------|-----------------|-------|---------|----------------|
| 3a | Part III, "Fountainhead of Tone" (line 175) | "...creating postural shifts, gait disturbances, and joint fixations -- initiating the cascade of dyskinesia, dysafferentation, dysponesis, dysautonomia, and degeneration." | ~25 | Consequence of tone distortion in the NeuroSpinal System | **CALLBACK** -- Brief mention, but these terms are never defined |
| 3b | Part IV, section 4.1 (line 190) | "...initiating the cascade of dyskinesia, dysafferentation, dysponesis, dysautonomia, and degeneration." | ~25 | Historical contrast -- what osseous models failed to address | **CALLBACK** -- Same terms, same lack of definition |
| 3c | Part VI, "The Sequence: From Threat to Release" step 8 (line 385) | "Cascade of Release: Myofibroblasts de-tension -> dural/fascial slack returns -> global tone reorganizes" | ~15 | Different cascade -- this is the RELEASE cascade, not the dysfunction cascade | **KEEP** -- This is a different concept (release pathway, not dysfunction pathway) |

**Assessment:** The dysfunction cascade (dyskinesia through degeneration) is mentioned twice but never defined anywhere in the paper. Each element is a technical term that the target audience (chiropractors) may or may not know. The cascade is important to the argument -- it describes the downstream consequences of aberrant NeuroSpinal tone.

**Decision Point for Author:** See Decision Point #1 below.

### Concept 4: "The body is an intelligent system that wants to correct"

| # | Location | First ~20 Words | Words | Purpose | Recommendation |
|---|----------|-----------------|-------|---------|----------------|
| 4a | Executive Summary, Thesis (line 15) | Implied -- "the body's best available adaptation to that primary tonal disturbance" | ~10 | Implied in framing | **KEEP** |
| 4b | Part I, "The Clinical Method," Premise (line 68) | "The intelligent system always seeks to self-correct; it is often missing accurate information..." | ~20 | Operational premise of the method | **KEEP** -- Definitive statement of the premise |
| 4c | Part I, "The Paradigm Shift" (line 82) | "...interacting with and communicating with the dynamic and intelligent living system..." | ~30 | Paradigm framing | **KEEP** -- Serves rhetorical purpose |
| 4d | Part VI, "Permission-Based Release Model" (line 339-340) | "...until it receives specific informational and mechanical input..." (system wants to release but needs permission) | ~30 | Mechanistic treatment of HOW the system self-corrects | **KEEP** -- Adds mechanistic depth |
| 4e | Part VI, "Key Principle" (line 389) | "TTC is not about forcing tissue change but delivering the least amount..." | ~25 | Summary principle in pathophysiology section | **KEEP** -- Natural conclusion |
| 4f | Part VIII, "What TTC Is and Is Not" (line 519) | "...delivering the least amount of the most effective information to an intelligent system that wants to correct" | ~20 | Comparative positioning | **KEEP** -- Different context |
| 4g | Part X, "Clinical Expectations" (line 579) | "...communicating a corrective intent through touch to an intelligent system that wants to respond and adjust itself" | ~20 | Clinical expectations restating | **CALLBACK** -- Redundant with Part I and Part VIII |
| 4h | Part XII, Epilogue (line 642) | "...communicating corrective intent through touch to an intelligent system designed to self-correct" | ~20 | Epilogue callback | **KEEP** -- Epilogue is the paper's landing; appropriate to echo the core thesis |

**Definitive home:** Part I (Premise) for the operational definition. Part XII (Epilogue) for the closing echo.

**Assessment:** This is the paper's core thesis and reasonably echoes throughout. The main redundancy is between Part X (lines 577-579) and Part I, where the same language is nearly verbatim. Part X should be shortened or reframed to add new content (clinical trajectory, practitioner integration) rather than restating the thesis.

---

### Concept 5: "Least amount of the most effective input"

| # | Location | First ~20 Words | Words | Purpose | Recommendation |
|---|----------|-----------------|-------|---------|----------------|
| 5a | Executive Thesis, Method (line 31) | "Deliver the least amount of the most effective input at the best window in..." | ~30 | Thesis-level definition | **KEEP** |
| 5b | Part I, "Dose" (line 72) | "The least amount of the most effective input. Enough to be heard by the system..." | ~25 | Operational definition within clinical method | **KEEP** -- Definitive home |
| 5c | Part VI, "Why Precision Matters" (lines 370-374) | "This is why the least amount of the most effective input works when gross force does not..." | ~200 | Full mechanistic explanation of WHY the principle works | **KEEP** -- Mechanistic rationale |
| 5d | Part VI, "Key Principle" (line 389) | "...delivering the least amount of the most effective information so that the system chooses to reorganize" | ~20 | Summary principle | **KEEP** -- Natural conclusion |
| 5e | Part VII, "Contact Parameters" (line 507-511) | "Amount: Minimal. Enough to be perceived. Not enough to threaten..." | ~40 | Protocol-level application | **KEEP** -- Clinical protocol detail |
| 5f | Part VIII, "What TTC Is and Is Not" (line 519) | "...delivering the least amount of the most effective information to an intelligent system..." | ~20 | Comparative positioning | **KEEP** |
| 5g | Part X, "Clinical Expectations" (line 577) | "It is about delivering the least amount of the most effective information..." | ~15 | Restated | **CALLBACK** -- Redundant with 5a, 5b, 5f |
| 5h | Part XI, Glossary (line 615-616) | "Least amount of the most effective input: Application ethic guiding TTC contacts..." | ~30 | Glossary definition | **KEEP** -- Glossary serves reference function |
| 5i | Part XII, Epilogue (line 642) | "By providing the least amount of the most effective input..." | ~15 | Epilogue echo | **KEEP** -- Closing echo |

**Assessment:** This phrase appears 9 times. Most serve legitimate purposes (thesis, method, mechanism, protocol, glossary, epilogue). Part X (5g) is the clearest redundancy.

---

### Concept 6: NeuroSpinal System Definition / Anatomical Composition

| # | Location | Words | Purpose | Recommendation |
|---|----------|-------|---------|----------------|
| 6a | Executive Summary (lines 15-18) | ~100 | Brief description within thesis | **KEEP** |
| 6b | Executive Thesis, System (line 25) | ~60 | Thesis-level definition | **KEEP** |
| 6c | Part II, full section (lines 86-130) | ~800 | Complete anatomical definition with structural composition | **KEEP** -- Definitive home |
| 6d | Part V, "Historical Context" (lines 238-251) | ~100 | Referenced in historical shift discussion | **KEEP** -- Contextual, not definitional |
| 6e | Part XI, Glossary (lines 619-620) | ~60 | Glossary entry | **KEEP** |

**Assessment:** No significant redundancy. Part II is the definitive home and the only place with full anatomical detail.

---

### Concept 7: Philosophy-Technique Disconnect / "We said tone but adjusted bones"

| # | Location | First ~20 Words | Words | Purpose | Recommendation |
|---|----------|-----------------|-------|---------|----------------|
| 7a | Part I, "The Clinical Method" (lines 60-66) | "This is not osseous, not articular... we are not engaging the nervous system through joint mobilization..." | ~60 | Clinical distinction | **KEEP** -- Operational statement |
| 7b | Part IV, section 4.1 (lines 188-190) | "...it began at the wrong point in the pathophysiological sequence. Osseous models started with joint fixation..." | ~100 | Historical critique | **KEEP** -- Historical perspective, different angle |
| 7c | Part IV, "Limits of Fixation-Focused Analysis" (lines 436-438) | "Structural techniques can achieve real, even lasting, changes... But they can do so only to the extent..." | ~60 | Nuanced assessment of structural approaches | **KEEP** -- Adds the important nuance that structural techniques CAN work when they influence NeuroSpinal tone |

**Assessment:** No significant redundancy. Part I and Part IV discuss the same disconnect from different angles (clinical vs. historical) and serve different argumentative purposes.

---

### Concept 8: Part I (Clinical Method) vs. Part VI (Pathophysiology) Overlap

This is the most significant structural overlap in the paper, as identified in RESEARCH.md.

| Part I Section | Part VI Counterpart | Overlap Degree | Assessment |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------|------------|
| The Clinical Problem (lines 42-51) -- allostatic response, misinformation/missing info | The Sequence: From Threat to Release (lines 376-389) | **MODERATE** -- Same mechanism but different depth. Part I gives the clinical framing; Part VI gives the 8-step mechanistic sequence | Both serve distinct purposes |
| The Conceptual Reframe (lines 53-56) | No counterpart | **NONE** -- Unique to Part I | -- |
| The Clinical Method (lines 58-74) | No counterpart (Part VII covers protocol details) | **LOW** -- Part VII expands on method but is protocol-specific, not redundant | -- |
| The Clinical Art (lines 77-78) | No counterpart | **NONE** -- Unique to Part I | -- |
| Part I generally: "body holds tension" | Part VI generally: "here is the mechanism of WHY it holds tension" | **LOW** -- Part I sets up the problem and method; Part VI provides the deep pathophysiology | Complementary, not redundant |

**Assessment:** The overlap identified in RESEARCH.md between "Part II" (old numbering) and "Part VI" (old numbering) has been significantly reduced in the current master paper. Part I (current) is concise and focused on clinical method. Part VI (current, titled "Pathophysiology of NeuroSpinal Subluxation") is detailed mechanistic pathophysiology. The allostatic response / protective meningeal contraction description in Part I (lines 42-51, ~200 words) establishes the "what" without the mechanistic "how." Part VI then provides the deep "how" through the Permission-Based Release Model and the persistence mechanisms. **This is well-structured as-is.**

**Recommendation:** No significant cuts needed. The current structure maintains the Part I = "what and why it matters clinically" / Part VI = "how it works mechanistically" distinction effectively. Minor: Part I's "Clinical Problem" section could add a brief forward reference to Part VI ("The full pathophysiology of this holding pattern is described in Part VI") to signal the reader.

---

### Additional Redundancies NOT in RESEARCH.md

#### Concept 9: "Never-ending neurological optimization" / "Not about maintenance"

| # | Location | Words | Recommendation |
|---|----------|-------|----------------|
| 9a | Executive Thesis, Outcome aim (line 33) | ~15 | **KEEP** -- Thesis level |
| 9b | Part VIII, "Not about maintenance..." (line 525) | ~15 | **KEEP** -- Comparative positioning |
| 9c | Part X, Clinical Expectations (line 581-589) | ~80 | **KEEP** -- Most detailed treatment with "decision space" concept |

**Assessment:** Appropriately distributed. No cuts needed.

#### Concept 10: "Verification of conversation" / Leg checks as the body's "yes"

| # | Location | Words | Recommendation |
|---|----------|-------|----------------|
| 10a | Part I, "The Clinical Art" (line 78) | ~20 | **KEEP** -- Brief mention in method summary |
| 10b | Part VII, section 7.2-7.3 (lines 483-500) | ~300 | **KEEP** -- Definitive home with full protocol detail |
| 10c | Part IV, "Verification of Conversation" section (lines 492-500 in current master) | ~120 | **Overlaps with Part VII** -- this section describes verification process in detail that is better placed in Part VII |

**Assessment:** Minor overlap between Part IV (old numbering for Global Tonal Analysis) and Part VII (TTC Analysis and Adjustment Protocol). Both discuss verification through leg checks. Since Part VII is the protocol section, the detailed verification discussion in Part IV's "Verification of Conversation" subsection is somewhat redundant. Consider trimming Part IV's verification discussion to a brief statement with forward reference to Part VII.

## Content Recovery Candidates

### Rendition 02 (Nov 2025, exec summary version)

| # | Source Section | Content Description | Assessment | Recommendation |
|---|---------------|---------------------|------------|----------------|
| R02-1 | Executive Summary | Rendition 02's Exec Summary lacks "The central question" opening and "Paradigm" section present in master 01. 02 has a simpler structure (Thesis, Core Insight, Clinical Consequence, Paradigm). | Master 01 has a STRONGER Executive Summary with the central question opening | **SKIP** -- Master is better |
| R02-2 | Section 2.5 "From Segmental to Systems Thinking" | Marked "[TO BE COMPLETED]" placeholder in rendition 04 (which has same structure as 02) | Does not exist in master | **AUTHOR DECIDE** -- Could this section concept be worth developing? It was planned but never written |
| R02-3 | Executive Thesis | Rendition 02 preserves the original Ontology-first ordering. Master 03 reordered to System-first | Master already has the reordered version | **SKIP** -- Already addressed |

### Rendition 03 (Nov 2025, polished final)

| # | Source Section | Content Description | Assessment | Recommendation |
|---|---------------|---------------------|------------|----------------|
| R03-1 | Part I, "The Paradigm Shift" | Rendition 03 has a shorter, tighter paradigm shift statement: "This is a move from segmental correction to system reorganization, from mechanical adjustment to informational precision, from force to conversation." | Master 01 has an expanded version with the same content plus additional framing | **SKIP** -- Master expands on it appropriately |
| R03-2 | Overall | Rendition 03 is structurally identical to rendition 05 (same 10-Part structure + Epilogue). No unique content found that is absent from master | -- | **SKIP** |

### Rendition 04 (Nov 2025, complete draft)

| # | Source Section | Content Description | Assessment | Recommendation |
|---|---------------|---------------------|------------|----------------|
| R04-1 | ABSTRACT (For IRAPS Submission) (lines 39-47) | A formal abstract with Thesis/Premises/Support/Synthesis structure, ~300 words. Designed for journal-style submission. Not in master. | This is a standalone piece of writing that could serve as an actual submission abstract | **AUTHOR DECIDE** -- Valuable for future journal submission. Not part of the white paper itself, but could be preserved as a resource |
| R04-2 | Section 1, Introduction (lines 51-101) | Expanded Introduction with "From Pressure and Compression to Tension" subsection, Haavik (2007) treatment, and "The NeuroSpinal System as Primary Tone Setter" preview | Much of this content was restructured into Parts I, IV, and II of the master | **SKIP** -- Content was reorganized, not lost |
| R04-3 | Section 2.3 "Allostatic Load" (lines 168-179) | Full allostatic load subsection with misinformation/missing information bullets -- this is the near-verbatim duplication identified in RESEARCH.md | Master 01 has this content in Part I (The Clinical Problem) | **SKIP** -- Content exists in master |
| R04-4 | Section 2.4 "Tonal Contributions" -- Epstein NSA description (lines 196-199) | Expanded description of NSA including respiratory wave, somatopsychic wave, and gateways | Master 01's Part V section on Epstein (line 264-265) is shorter and omits wave phenomena detail | **RECOVER** -- The respiratory wave and somatopsychic wave are distinctive features of NSA that help the reader understand the contrast with TTC. Add 1-2 sentences to the Epstein entry in Part V |
| R04-5 | Section 2.4 "Tonal Contributions" -- Senzon expanded description (lines 199) | Much more detailed Senzon treatment including Integral Methodological Pluralism, phenomenology, autopoiesis | Master 01's Senzon entry (line 267) is shorter | **SKIP** -- Master version is appropriately concise for a white paper |
| R04-6 | Section 2.5 "From Segmental to Systems Thinking" (line 229-231) | Placeholder "[TO BE COMPLETED]" -- this section was planned but never written | Not in master | **AUTHOR DECIDE** -- Same as R02-2 |
| R04-7 | Section 4.2b "Why the Contracture Persists" (lines 345-373) | Detailed 4-point explanation of persistence + final paragraph on "when the system encounters brief, low-amplitude range of motion..." | This content EXISTS in master Part VI but in condensed form (the master has the same 4-point structure) | **SKIP** -- Already in master |
| R04-8 | Section 4.3 "Informational Interference" (lines 377-389) | Standalone subsection with 4 bullet points: Afferent Distortion, Conduction & Transport Impedance, Central Processing Bias, Descending Control Default | Master 01 does NOT have this as a standalone subsection. The content is distributed across Part I and Part VI | **AUTHOR DECIDE** -- The 4-point breakdown (especially "Central Processing Bias" and "Descending Control Default") adds specificity not present in master. Could be a brief subsection in Part VI |

### Rendition 05 (Nov 2025, revised draft)

| # | Source Section | Content Description | Assessment | Recommendation |
|---|---------------|---------------------|------------|----------------|
| R05-1 | Overall | Rendition 05 is structurally very close to rendition 03. Same 10-Part structure. No unique content identified beyond what the master already contains | -- | **SKIP** |

### Rendition 06 (Nov 2025, original draft)

| # | Source Section | Content Description | Assessment | Recommendation |
|---|---------------|---------------------|------------|----------------|
| R06-1 | Part IX, "System, Method, and Aim" (lines 112-118) | This is the section flagged in Nov 2025 feedback as heavily redundant with Parts I, V, and VIII. Contains "it's own" possessive error | Master has eliminated Part IX entirely | **SKIP** -- Deliberately eliminated per Nov 2025 feedback |
| R06-2 | Ontology-first Executive Thesis ordering | Ontology is listed first in rendition 06 (before System, Dysfunction, etc.) | Master moved Ontology to last position | **SKIP** -- Already addressed |
| R06-3 | Part VI, Tonal Energetics (line 96) | Original language: "employ tonal awareness with energy work, emphasizing energetic therapeutics and often the facilitation of kundalini; this includes the intentional moving of or addition of energetic forces not involved in pure tonal chiropractic" | Master uses neutral language per Nov 2025 feedback | **SKIP** -- Already fixed |
| R06-4 | Part XI, "uniqueness and gift of chiropractic" (line 141) | Original sentimental language | Master uses "defining contribution" | **SKIP** -- Already fixed |

### Rendition 07 (Jun 2025, Notion export)

This is the most important rendition for content recovery as it has substantially different structure and unique content.

| # | Source Section | Content Description | Assessment | Recommendation |
|---|---------------|---------------------|------------|----------------|
| R07-1 | Section 2.2 "Compression Myth" table (lines 63-68) | Table comparing Breig and Haavik findings in a 3-column format (Key Figure, Core Finding, Implication) | Master has this content in prose form in Part IV section 4.2 | **AUTHOR DECIDE** -- The table format is cleaner for quick reference. Could be added as a sidebar or callout in Part IV |
| R07-2 | Section 2.3 "Foundational Contributions" table (lines 74-84) | Table of tonal technique history (Logan Basic through NSA) in 2-column format (Era/Technique, Tonal Contribution) | Master has this content in prose form in Part V "Key Pioneers" | **AUTHOR DECIDE** -- Table format provides better scanability. White papers commonly use tables for this type of information |
| R07-3 | Section 2.4 "OsseoTonal Techniques" table (lines 92-99) | Table of OsseoTonal techniques (TRT, MC2, BGI, MLS, Kairos, Syntropy, TIC, Pneuma) with features | Master Part V mentions OsseoTonal briefly (lines 270-273) but omits technique-specific detail | **RECOVER** -- The technique comparison table is valuable for practitioners evaluating where TTC fits. Master's Part V "OsseoTonal Models" section should reference or include this |
| R07-4 | Section 3.1 "Fascial Continuity" subsection + Evidence Snapshot sidebar (lines 174-184) | Dedicated subsection on myodural bridge with Evidence Snapshot callout box (Liu et al., 2017) | Master has myodural bridge mention in Part II (line 102) but without the dedicated Evidence Snapshot format | **AUTHOR DECIDE** -- Evidence Snapshot format is engaging for readers. Could enhance master's Part II |
| R07-5 | Section 3.2b "Allostatic Tone Response" (lines 209-230) | Standalone subsection with "Adaptive Purpose" (3 bullet points) and "Cost of Adaptation" table (misinformation/missing information in table format) | Master has this content in Part I (The Clinical Problem) but in prose form | **SKIP** -- Master's prose treatment is more appropriate for a white paper than the bullet/table format |
| R07-6 | Section 3.3 "Piezoelectric Signal Transduction" (lines 240-242) | Dedicated subsection explaining how collagen generates electrical charge under mechanical stress | Master mentions this briefly via Oschman and Ho & Knight references but does NOT have a dedicated piezoelectric treatment | **AUTHOR DECIDE** -- Adds scientific depth. Could strengthen Part II's "Information Transmission" section with 2-3 sentences |
| R07-7 | Section 3.3 "Liquid-Crystalline Conduction" (lines 244-246) | Dedicated subsection on liquid crystal water layers as proton-conductive pathways | Same as above -- master references Ho & Knight (1998) but without the mechanism detail | **AUTHOR DECIDE** -- Same consideration as R07-6 |
| R07-8 | Section 3.3 "Mechanotransductive Memory" + Evidence Snapshot (lines 248-258) | Dedicated subsection on fascia retaining tension patterns ("tension engrams") with sidebar | Master mentions "mechanical memories" in Part II line 126 citing Fede et al. (2018) | **SKIP** -- Master has the concept. The "tension engrams" terminology is not standard and may weaken credibility |
| R07-9 | Section 6, "Information Pathways and the Best Window In" (lines 451-516) | Entire section (6.0-6.3) with "Why Information Matters More Than Force," "The Body as an Information System," "Finding the Best Window In," and "Why Force Isn't the Language of Change" | Much of this content appears in master Part VI and Part VII, but the framing "Why Force Isn't the Language of Change" (section 6.3) is unique | **AUTHOR DECIDE** -- Section 6.3's argument (more force = more noise in a defensive system) is a compelling addition. Currently missing from master as a standalone argument |
| R07-10 | Section 7.3 "Objective Metrics" (lines 553-562) | HRV, sEMG, SEPs, Subjective well-being metrics with Evidence Snapshot sidebar | Master has these metrics in Part IX (Evidence Map, lines 555-557) as a research priority list | **SKIP** -- Master already lists these. R07's framing as "Early Trends" is more assertive than appropriate given lack of published TTC-specific studies |
| R07-11 | Section 8 "Conclusion" (lines 585-618) | Full conclusion section with summary of the model, "chiropractic future" framing, and poetic closing | Master has Part XII (Epilogue) serving this function | **SKIP** -- Master's Epilogue is more effective |
| R07-12 | Appendix A "Evolution of Tonal and OsseoTonal Techniques" full tables (lines 623-658) | Comprehensive technique history tables including Logan Basic, DNFT, Upper Cervical/Grostic, Toftness, Thompson, NSA, Pierce-Stillwagon, Access Workshop, plus OsseoTonal table | Master Part V has this in prose. The tables include techniques NOT in the master: Logan Basic (1931), Thompson Technique (1955), Access Workshop (2002), and Pierce-Stillwagon in more detail | **RECOVER** -- The additional techniques (especially Logan Basic as arguably the first tonal technique) are historically significant. Add to Part V or to a historical appendix |
| R07-13 | Glossary -- additional terms (lines 666-713) | Additional glossary terms not in master: "Tonal Subluxation," "Tonal Pressure Testing," "Allostatic Load," "Informational Input (vs. Adjustment)," "Living Matrix" | Master glossary (Part XI) does not include these 5 terms | **RECOVER** -- "Tonal Pressure Testing," "Allostatic Load," and "Tonal Adjustment" / "OsseoTonal Adjustment" are important terms for the glossary. Add definitions |

### Outstanding TODO Items

1. **First Principles tension** (P3): "incomplete and abnormal movement of spinal segments" in the First Principles statement appears to conflict with the paper's tonal paradigm. The Nov 2025 feedback offered two options:
   - **Option A:** Acknowledge reinterpretation -- "...reinterpreted through a global tensional lens rather than a segmental mechanical one"
   - **Option B:** Emphasize nervous system -- "...optimizing nervous system function by addressing physical interference. Where traditional approaches focused on segmental mechanics, TTC addresses global tone in the NeuroSpinal System itself"
   - See Decision Point #2

2. **Forward reference from Part I to Part VI:** Add a brief sentence in "The Clinical Problem" section noting that the full pathophysiology is described in Part VI.

3. **Part X (Clinical Expectations) redundancy:** Part X substantially restates content from Parts I and VIII. Consider shortening the opening paragraph to add new value rather than repeating "not about moving bones."

## Decision Points

The author must make decisions on the following before Plan 02 can execute:

---

### Decision 1: Cascade Sequence Treatment

The cascade "dyskinesia, dysafferentation, dysponesis, dysautonomia, and degeneration" appears twice (Part III line 175, Part IV line 190) but is never defined.

- [ ] **Option A (Minimal):** Keep the cascade as brief mentions in both locations. Add glossary entries for each term so readers can look them up. No new subsection.
- [ ] **Option B (Consolidate + Define):** Add a brief definitional paragraph in Part VI (Pathophysiology) that maps each element of the cascade:
  - Dyskinesia = movement dysfunction from altered motor output
  - Dysafferentation = distorted sensory input from aberrant mechanoreceptor activity
  - Dysponesis = misdirected neurological effort / inappropriate muscle activation
  - Dysautonomia = autonomic dysregulation from sustained sympathetic bias
  - Degeneration = progressive structural/functional decline from chronic maladaptation
  Then have Parts III and IV reference Part VI for the definitions.

**Researcher recommendation:** Option B -- the cascade is important terminology that currently floats without definition. A brief definitional paragraph (50-100 words) adds clarity without significant length.

---

### Decision 2: First Principles Tension with Tonal Paradigm

The First Principles statement reads: "the progressive reduction of physical interference to the physical nervous system maintained by incomplete and abnormal movement of spinal segments."

"Incomplete and abnormal movement of spinal segments" is the traditional chiropractic framing that TTC explicitly moves beyond. The Nov 2025 feedback flagged this tension specifically.

- [ ] **Option A (Acknowledge reinterpretation):** Change to: "...the progressive reduction of physical interference to the nervous system -- reinterpreted through a global tensional lens rather than a segmental mechanical one."
- [ ] **Option B (Emphasize nervous system):** Change to: "...optimizing nervous system function by addressing physical interference. Where traditional approaches focused on segmental mechanics, TTC addresses global tone in the NeuroSpinal System itself."
- [ ] **Option C (Keep as-is):** Preserve the traditional language deliberately, because TTC grounds itself in chiropractic tradition before introducing the paradigm shift. The tension is intentional and resolved in the third paragraph of the First Principles section.

**Note:** The current First Principles section (rendition 03/master) already includes a third paragraph that resolves this tension: "In this understanding, subluxation is fundamentally a state of altered NeuroSpinal tone and informational interference, originating from defensive meningeal bracing." However, rendition 01 (master) does NOT have this expanded First Principles section -- it only has the brief Executive Summary + Executive Thesis. The full First Principles section from renditions 03-05 was absorbed into the current structure.

**IMPORTANT:** The master paper (01) actually has no standalone "First Principles" section. The original "First Principles" content now lives in the First Principles paragraph that is part of the front matter. The tension is between the First Principles opening ("incomplete and abnormal movement of spinal segments") and the rest of the paper. The current paper resolves this in the third paragraph of the First Principles section in renditions 03-05, but in the master (01), the First Principles section does not exist as a separate section -- its content is distributed across the Executive Summary and Part I.

**Clarification needed:** Does the master paper (01) include a standalone "First Principles" section? Searching the master text: the master does NOT have a "First Principles" heading. The content appears in renditions 03-06 as "First Principles" but in the master (01), the paper opens with the Executive Summary followed by the Executive Thesis. The traditional language "incomplete and abnormal movement of spinal segments" does NOT appear in the master (01). It appears in renditions 03-06 and in the vital aspects document (08).

**Updated assessment:** This decision point may be moot for the master paper itself. The language "incomplete and abnormal movement of spinal segments" does NOT appear in rendition 01 (master). It was part of earlier renditions' First Principles sections. The vital aspects checklist (08) still uses it, but that is a standalone reference document. **No action needed on the master paper unless the author wants to add the First Principles section back.**

---

### Decision 3: Part X (Clinical Expectations) Trimming

Part X currently opens with: "TTC is not about moving bones. It is about delivering the least amount of the most effective information to an intelligent system that wants to correct."

This substantially restates Part I and Part VIII without adding new content. The rest of Part X (trajectory, practitioner integration, adaptive reorganization) IS unique and valuable.

- [ ] **Approve:** Shorten Part X's opening to a brief callback ("As described in Part I...") and preserve the unique content (trajectory, practitioner integration tips, adaptive reorganization with decision space/variability/regulation bullet points).
- [ ] **Keep as-is:** The repetition serves a rhetorical purpose -- Part X is the "so what" section for practitioners and the echo reinforces the message.
- [ ] **Modify:** (Describe specific changes)

**Key finding:** The master paper (rendition 01) is in significantly better structural shape than RESEARCH.md anticipated. Many of the redundancies identified in the research were based on older rendition numbering and have been partially resolved in the Feb 2026 rewrite. The most actionable items are:

1. The cascade sequence needs definition (Decision 1)
2. The First Principles tension needs resolution (Decision 2) -- though it may be moot in the current master
3. Part X can be tightened (Decision 3)
4. Several content recovery items from rendition 07 (Notion export) offer genuine improvements
5. Glossary expansion is straightforward and uncontroversial
