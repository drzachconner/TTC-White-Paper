<objective>
Full structural audit of the master paper — map all redundancy, diff all renditions for lost content, and gap-analyze the Nov 2025 editorial feedback. Present findings to the author for approval before any edits begin.

Purpose: The user decisions (CONTEXT.md) explicitly require presenting findings for author approval before adding or removing content. This plan produces the complete audit that Plan 02 will execute against.

Output: `02-01-AUDIT.md` — a structured findings report with recommendations, reviewed and annotated by the author.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Complete structural audit with redundancy map, content recovery diff, and editorial feedback gap analysis</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/02-structure-redundancy/02-01-AUDIT.md</files>
  <action>
Read the master paper (renditions/01_2026-02-03_MASTER_PAPER_COMPLETE.md) in its entirety. Then perform three analyses:

**1. Redundancy Map (confirms and extends RESEARCH.md findings)**

For each of the 8 concepts identified in RESEARCH.md (misinformation/missing information, "we do not seek to apply force," cascade sequence, "body is intelligent system," "least amount of most effective input," NeuroSpinal System definition, philosophy-technique disconnect, Part II vs Part VI overlap), search the master paper and document EVERY instance with:
- Exact section location (Part/subsection/approximate line)
- First ~20 words of the passage for identification
- Word count of the treatment
- Purpose in its current location (introductory, definitional, rhetorical reinforcement, or pure repetition)
- Recommendation: KEEP (serves unique purpose), CALLBACK (replace with "As described in [Part X]..."), or CUT (no value in this location)
- For KEEP items, note which location should be the "definitive home"

Also identify any additional redundancies NOT in the RESEARCH.md list.

**2. Content Recovery Diff**

For each rendition 02-07, read section by section and identify content that does NOT appear in the master (rendition 01). For each unique piece of content found:
- Source rendition and section
- Brief description of the content (~1-2 sentences)
- Assessment: RECOVER (valuable and missing), SKIP (deliberately omitted, lower quality), or AUTHOR DECIDE (could go either way)
- For RECOVER items: where in the master it should be inserted
- Pay special attention to rendition 07 (Notion export) which has unique structural content per RESEARCH.md findings: fascial biophysics, clinical outcomes metrics, technique comparison tables

**3. Editorial Feedback Gap Analysis**

Read both Nov 2025 feedback documents:
- editorial/2025-11-01_detailed_feedback.md
- editorial/2025-11-01_suggested_refinements.md

For each feedback item, check against the master and classify as:
- DONE (already incorporated)
- TODO (still outstanding, should be addressed in Phase 2)
- PHASE 4 (voice/register issue, defer to Phase 4)
- SKIP (deliberately not done per author decision)

Include the specific outstanding items:
- P1 "it's/its" possessive error verification (search master for "it's own" or similar)
- P3 First Principles tension with tonal paradigm — present both options from suggested_refinements.md
- Part II vs Part VI overlap resolution — present recommendation with specific text

**4. Decision Points for Author**

Compile a clear list of decisions the author needs to make:
1. Cascade sequence treatment: Option A (minimal, keep brief mentions) or Option B (add definitional mapping in Part VI with cross-references)
2. First Principles tension: Option A (acknowledge reinterpretation through global tensional lens) or Option B (emphasize nervous system function, addressing physical interference)
3. Part II "Clinical Problem" trimming: approve shortening to ~50% with forward reference to Part VI
4. Each RECOVER content item: approve/reject
5. Each TODO editorial feedback item: approve/reject

Write ALL findings to `.planning/phases/02-structure-redundancy/02-01-AUDIT.md` in a clean, scannable format with clear section headers and decision checkboxes.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT modify the master paper in this task. This is read-only analysis.
  </action>
  <verify>
- File `.planning/phases/02-structure-redundancy/02-01-AUDIT.md` exists and is non-empty
- File contains sections: "## Redundancy Findings", "## Content Recovery Candidates", "## Editorial Feedback Gap Analysis", "## Decision Points"
- Every concept from RESEARCH.md redundancy map appears in the findings
- At least renditions 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07 are referenced in the content recovery section
- Decision points section has numbered items with clear options
  </verify>
  <done>
A comprehensive audit file exists that maps every redundancy instance with specific locations and recommendations, lists all content recovery candidates from renditions 02-07, identifies all outstanding editorial feedback items, and presents clear decision points for the author — all without modifying the master paper.
  </done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Author reviews audit findings and approves action plan</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/02-structure-redundancy/02-01-AUDIT.md</files>
  <action>
Present the completed audit file to the author for review. The author must make decisions on all open points before Plan 02 can execute. Specifically:

1. Open `.planning/phases/02-structure-redundancy/02-01-AUDIT.md`
2. Review each section:
   - **Redundancy Findings**: For each concept, review the "definitive home" recommendation and the keep/cut/callback assignments. Mark any you disagree with.
   - **Content Recovery Candidates**: For each RECOVER item, approve or reject. For AUTHOR DECIDE items, make your call.
   - **Editorial Feedback Gap Analysis**: Review TODO items — approve or defer each one.
   - **Decision Points**: Make your choice on each numbered decision:
     1. Cascade sequence: Option A or B?
     2. First Principles tension: Option A or B?
     3. Part II trimming: Approve or modify?
     4. Content recovery: Approve/reject each item
     5. Editorial feedback: Approve/reject each TODO
3. You can annotate the file directly or describe your decisions verbally.
  </action>
  <verify>Author has provided decisions on all open points — either "approved as-is" or specific modifications to the recommendations.</verify>
  <done>Author-approved action plan exists with clear decisions for every redundancy instance, content recovery candidate, and editorial feedback item. Plan 02 can proceed unambiguously.</done>
