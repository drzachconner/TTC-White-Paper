- [x] **CITE-04**: All in-text citations match References entries

### Structure & Redundancy

- [ ] **STRC-01**: Executive Summary leads with clinical mechanism, then philosophical frame
- [ ] **STRC-02**: "Misinformation / missing information" framework appears in one primary location with brief cross-references elsewhere

- [ ] **STRC-06**: Unincorporated Nov 2025 editorial feedback applied

### Credibility & Claims

- [ ] **CRED-01**: Every factual/clinical claim reviewed for evidence strength match
- [ ] **CRED-02**: Intent section (PEAR/RNG) treatment decided and implemented (keep/reframe/appendix)
- [ ] **CRED-03**: Evidence Map section honestly distinguishes established vs emerging vs speculative
- [ ] **CRED-04**: No overclaiming — citation strength matches claim strength

### Voice & Polish

- [ ] **VOIC-01**: Register harmonized — clinical-scientific primary, philosophical as intentional seasoning
- [ ] **VOIC-02**: AI-sounding phrasing eliminated throughout
- [ ] **VOIC-03**: Consistent terminology (pick one term where variants exist)
- [ ] **VOIC-04**: Prose tightened — filler removed, transitions sharpened

### Final Delivery

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Journal submission formatting | White paper format chosen deliberately |
| New original research / data | Editorial refinement only |
| Rewriting from scratch | Refine existing voice, not replace it |
| Graphic design / layout | Content-only project; design is separate |
| New sections or major additions | Consolidate and polish what exists |
