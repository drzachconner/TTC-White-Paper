**Vital Aspects of Talsky Tonal Chiropractic Training**

Talsky Tonal Chiropractic (TTC) first and foremost returns to the original intent of chiropractic—the

progressive reduction of physical interference to the physical nervous system maintained by incomplete

and abnormal movement of spinal segments. TTC represents a profound shift in how we interact with the

nervous system. For those accustomed to structural models focused on mobilizing joints and releasing

segmental fixations, this approach invites a new lens—one that begins with the recognition that the body

is an intelligent system that wants to correct.

TTC is not about us fixing someone else, and is much more than the act of delivering an adjustment. TTC

is about interacting with and communicating with the dynamic and intelligent living system that is the

human body, and learning the language of this intelligent, adaptive, and responsive living body in order to

engage in a dialog with the intelligence of its nervous system to help it better adjust itself. To that end:

• We do not seek to apply force to what is stuck. **Instead, we seek to engage what is ready.**

• We are not looking for what's fixated—**we are looking for the best window in.**

• We are not looking for the most resistance—**we are looking for the most receptivity.**

**This is not osseous, not articular.**

TTC shifts the paradigm: we are not engaging the nervous system through joint mobilization or osseous

thrusts. Instead of applying force into joint spaces to stimulate mechanoreceptors, TTC delivers precise,

non-articular communication through touch to the soft tissue and meningeal system—communicating

directly with the tone and tension of the *NeuroSpinal System*.

We are not working with bones—we are working with a complex, sensory-rich, independently motile

suspension system known as the **NeuroSpinal System**.

The NeuroSpinal System, also referred to as the *Cranio-Spinal Meningeal Functional Unit*, includes the

brain, the spinal cord, and the multilayered meningeal system—composed of the pia mater (including the

dentate ligament), the arachnoid space (including the cerebrospinal fluid), and the dura mater—with

particular emphasis on where the dura mater attaches to the movable bony segments of the cranium and

spine. **This system is not passive—it is active, dynamic, and independently motile.**

The multi-layered meningeal system acts as an active communication transfer mechanism to and from the

CNS—predominantly through non-synaptic pathways. This system possesses independent contractile

motility and is in constant motion, modulating its tone moment to moment as it continuously assesses and

responds to changes in tension, movement, and the perception of threat. It actively contracts under actual

or perceived stress, and expands and relaxes as that stress resolves. **Because of this dynamic**

**responsiveness, the meningeal system functions as the primary tone setter in the body**, governing the

global tension patterns that shape adaptability, breath, posture, energy, and coherence.

**The TTC Approach:**

The input is non-articular and non-osseous, delivered through soft tissue and dural access points—not

through joints.

Every contact is made with the intent to influence the whole, not just a part.

We engage the location where the system is most open, responsive, and receptive to input.

**This is not about moving bones—it's about communicating a corrective intent through touch to an**

**intelligent system that wants to respond and adjust itself.**
